// JS initially and still prototype based programming language
// JS  : added synctatically sugar : Object oriented programming language

// object/ instance of class , class which is blueprint 

// object can have a special feature 

// prototype based     // Obejct based
                
                //Javascript : class , object , constructor ( we are pretending its oop but we come back at prototype based , it looks like)
                // (its class based but its just a mask....)
                // (Is it truly oop based : yeah it supports everything , but behind the scene still prototype )

// prototype : extra properties and functionality in any given datatype....
